Given an array of integers arr[] that is first strictly increasing and then maybe strictly decreasing, find the bitonic point, that is the maximum element in the array.
Bitonic Point is a point before which elements are strictly increasing and after which elements are strictly decreasing.

Note: It is guaranteed that the array contains exactly one bitonic point.

  public:
    int findMaximum(vector<int> &arr) {
        // code here
       sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        int n = arr.size();
        return arr[n-1];
    }
};
