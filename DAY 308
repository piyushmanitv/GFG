Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 49.55%Submissions: 172K+Points: 4Average Time: 15m
Given an integer array height[] where height[i] represents the height of the i-th stair, a frog starts from the first stair 
and wants to reach the last stair. From any stair i, the frog has two options: it can either jump to the (i+1)th stair or the (i+2)th stair. The cost of a jump is the absolute difference 
in height between the two stairs. Determine the minimum total cost required for the frog to reach the last stair.










class Solution {
  public:
    int minCost(vector<int>& height) {
        // Code here
        if(height.size() == 1) return 0;
        int first = 0;
        int second = abs(height[1]-height[0]);
        for(int i = 2;i<height.size();i++){
            int s = second+abs(height[i]-height[i-1]);
            int f = first+abs(height[i]-height[i-2]);
            first = second;
            second = min(f,s);
        }
        return second;
    }
};
