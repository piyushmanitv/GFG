Count of distinct substrings
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 40.21%Submissions: 28K+Points: 4
Given a string s consisting of lowercase English characters, determine the total number of distinct non-empty substrings present in the string. A substring is defined as a contiguous block of characters within the string.

Two substrings are considered distinct if their contents differ, even if they originate from different positions in the string.

Note: The empty substring is not counted.
