Minimum Steps to Halve Sum
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 60.23%Submissions: 9K+Points: 4
Given an array arr[], find the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of its elements less than or equal to half of 
the original sum. In one operation, you may replace any element with half of its value (with floating-point precision).









class Solution {
  public:
    int minOperations(vector<int>& arr) {
        // code here
        priority_queue<double> pq;
        double sum = 0;
        for (int it : arr) {
            pq.push(it);
            sum += it;
        }
        double req = sum / 2.0;
        int cnt = 0;
        while (sum > req) {
            double top = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            sum -= top;
            top /= 2.0;
            sum += top;
            pq.push(top);
            cnt++;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
