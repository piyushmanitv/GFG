Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 39.46%Submissions: 80K+Points: 4Average Time: 20m
Given a binary array arr[] containing only 0s and 1s and an integer k, you are allowed to flip at most k 0s to 1s. 
Find the maximum number of consecutive 1's that can be obtained in the array after performing the operation at most k times.









class Solution {
  public:
    int maxOnes(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        // code here
        int left = 0, right = 0, zeros = 0, maxLen = 0;
        
        while(right < arr.size()){
            if(arr[right] == 0) zeros++;
            
            while(zeros > k){
                if(arr[left] == 0) zeros--;
                left++;
            }
            
            maxLen = max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
            right++;
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
};
