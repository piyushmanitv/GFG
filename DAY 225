You are given an array arr[] of size n, where arr[i] represents the number of soldiers in the i-th troop. You are also given an integer k.
A troop is considered "lucky" if its number of soldiers is a multiple of k. Find the minimum total number of soldiers to add across all 
troops so that at least ⌈n / 2⌉ troops become lucky.





class Solution {
  public:
    int minSoldiers(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        // code here
        int n=arr.size();
        priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int>>pq;
        int count=0;
        for(auto it:arr){
            if(it%k)
            pq.push(k-(it%k));
            else{
                count++;
            }
        }
        int sum=0;
        int val=(n+1)/2;
        while(count<val){
            sum+=pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            count++;
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
