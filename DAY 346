You are given a square matrix of size n x n. Your task is to find the transpose of the given matrix.
The transpose of a matrix is obtained by converting all the rows to columns and all the columns to rows.









class Solution {
  public:
    vector<vector<int>> transpose(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
        // code here
        if (mat.empty() || mat[0].empty()) return {};

        int m = mat.size();
        int n = mat[0].size();

        vector<vector<int>> res(n, vector<int>(m));
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                res[j][i] = mat[i][j];
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
