Sort a linked list of 0s, 1s and 2s




Given a linked list where nodes can contain values 0s, 1s, and 2s only. The task is to 
segregate 0s, 1s, and 2s linked list such that all zeros segregate to the head side, 2s 
at the end of the linked list, and 1s in the middle of 0s and 2s.

  Node is defined as

    int data;
    struct Node *next;
    Node(int x) {
        data = x;
        next = NULL;
    }
