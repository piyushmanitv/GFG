You have a row of flowers, where each flower blooms after a specific day. The array arr[] represents
the blooming schedule: arr[i] is the day the flower at position i will bloom. To create a bouquet,
you need to collect k adjacent bloomed flowers. Each flower can only be used in one bouquet.

Your goal is to find the minimum number of days required to make exactly m bouquets. If it is 
not possible to make m bouquets with the given arrangement, return -1.







class Solution {
  public:
    int minDaysBloom(vector<int>& arr, int k, int m) {
        // Code here
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        if ( arr.size() <  m * k) return -1;
        return arr[m * k-1];
    }
};
