Given a square matrix mat[][], the task is to swap the elements of the major and minor diagonals.



Major Diagonal: Elements that lie from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the matrix (i.e., where row index equals column index).
Minor Diagonal: Elements that lie from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner (i.e., where the sum of row and column indices equals n - 1).








class Solution {
  public:
    void swapDiagonal(vector<vector<int>> &mat) {
        // code here
        int n = mat.size();
        int a=0,b=0,x=0,y=n-1;
        for(int i =0;i<n;i++){  
            swap(mat[a][b],mat[x][y]);
            a++;b++;x++;y--;
        }
    }
};
