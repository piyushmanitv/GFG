Given an integer n, the task is to count the number of binary strings of length n that contains at least one pair of consecutive 1's.
Note: A binary string is a sequence made up of only 0's and 1's.







class Solution {
  public:
    int countConsec(int n) {
        // code here
        if(n<2) return 0;
        int a=2;
        int b=3;
        
        for(int i=3;i<=n;i++){
            int temp=a+b;
            a=b;
            b=temp;
        }
        int total = 1 << n;
        return total-b;
    }
};
