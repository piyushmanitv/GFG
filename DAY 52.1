Kth from End of Linked List



Given the head of a linked list and the number k, Your task is to find 
the kth node from the end. If k is more than the number of nodes, then 
the output should be -1.






class Solution {
  public:
    int getKthFromLast(Node *head, int k) {
        struct Node* curr = head;
        int len = 0;
        while(curr != NULL) {
            curr = curr -> next;
            len++;
        }
        curr = head;
        if (k > len) return -1;
        for(int i = 0; (i<len-k); i++) {
            curr = curr -> next;
        }
        return curr -> data;
    }
};
