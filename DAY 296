K Closest Points to Origin
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 62.4%Submissions: 25K+Points: 4
Given an integer k and an array of points points[][], where each point is represented as points[i] = [xi, yi] on the X-Y plane. Return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance, defined as:
distance = sqrt( (x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2 )

Note: You can return the k closest points in any order, the driver code will print them in sorted order.
Test Cases are generated such that there will be a unique ans.
