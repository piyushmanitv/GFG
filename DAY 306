Max DAG Edges
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 80.4%Submissions: 1K+Points: 4
Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with V vertices numbered from 0 to V-1 and E edges, represented as a 2D array edges[][], where each entry edges[i] = [u, v] denotes a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v, find the maximum number of additional edges that can be added to the graph without forming any cycles.

Note: The resulting graph must remain a DAG, meaning that adding any further edge would not create a cycle.










class Solution {
  public:
    int maxEdgesToAdd(int v, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        // code here
        return (v*(v-1))/2 - edges.size();
    }
};
