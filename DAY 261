Next Greater Element in Circular Array
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 56.97%Submissions: 63K+Points: 4
Given a circular integer array arr[], the task is to determine the next greater element (NGE) for each element in the array.

The next greater element of an element arr[i] is the first element that is greater than arr[i] when traversing circularly. If no such element exists, return -1 for that position.

Note: Since the array is circular, after reaching the last element, the search continues from the beginning until we have looked at all elements once.









class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> nextGreater(vector<int> &arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
    vector<int> result(n, -1);
    stack<int> st;
    for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
        int num = arr[i % n];
        while (!st.empty() && arr[st.top()] < num) {
            result[st.top()] = num;
            st.pop();
        }

        if (i < n) {
            st.push(i);
        }
    }
    return result;
    }
};
