Longest Common Increasing Subsequence
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 37.37%Submissions: 11K+Points: 4
Given two arrays, a[] and b[], find the length of the longest common increasing subsequence(LCIS).

Note:  LCIS refers to a subsequence that is present in both arrays and strictly increases.









class Solution {
public:
    int LCIS(vector<int> &a, vector<int> &b) {
        int n = a.size(), m = b.size();
        vector<int> dp(m, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int currentMax = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (a[i] == b[j]) {
                    dp[j] = currentMax + 1;
                }
                else if (b[j] < a[i]) {
                    currentMax = max(currentMax, dp[j]);
                }
            }
        }
        return *max_element(dp.begin(), dp.end());
    }
};
