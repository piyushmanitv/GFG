A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. A party is being organized by some people. 
A square matrix mat[][] of size n*n is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j 
is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. You need to return the index of the celebrity in the party, if the celebrity does not exist, return -1.

Note: Follow 0-based indexing.









class Solution {
  public:
    int celebrity(vector<vector<int> >& mat) {
        // code here
        int row = mat.size();
        int col = mat[0].size();
        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            bool rowCheck = true, colCheck = true;
            
            for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
                if (i != j && mat[i][j] != 0) {
                    rowCheck = false;
                    break;
                }
            }

            for (int j = 0; j < col; j++) {
                if (i != j && mat[j][i] != 1) {
                    colCheck = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
    
            if (rowCheck && colCheck)
                return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
