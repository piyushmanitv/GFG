Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 39.0%Submissions: 2K+Points: 4Average Time: 20m
Given an array arr[] consisting of positive integers and an integer k. You are allowed to perform at most k operations, where in each operation, you can increment any one element of the array by 1.

Determine the maximum possible median of the array that can be achieved after performing at most k such operations.











class Solution {
  public:
    int maximizeMedian(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        // code here
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        int n = arr.size();
        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq;
        if(n%2 == 0)
            pq.push(arr[n/2 - 1]);
        
        for(int i = n/2; i < n; i++)
        {
            pq.push(arr[i]);    
        }
        
        while(k)
        {
            int top = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            pq.push(top+1);
            k--;
        }
        
        if(n%2 == 0)
        {
            int top = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            return (top + pq.top())/2;
        }
        else
            return pq.top();
    }
};
