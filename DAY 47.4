Count Digits



Given a positive integer n, count the number of digits in n that divide n
evenly (i.e., without leaving a remainder). Return the total number of such digits.

A digit d of n divides n evenly if the remainder when n is divided by d 
is 0 (n % d == 0).
Digits of n should be checked individually. If a digit is 0, it should 
be ignored because division by 0 is undefined.






class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to count the number of digits in n that evenly divide n
    int evenlyDivides(int n) {
        // code here
        int count=0;
        int r=n;
        
     while(n>0){
         int rem=n%10;
        if(rem!=0&&r%rem==0){
        count++;
     }
        n=n/10;
     }
     
        return count;
    }
};
