Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 51.68%Submissions: 25K+Points: 2
Given two strings s1 and s2. You have to check that s1 is a subsequence of s2 or not.
Note: A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.








class Solution {
  public:
    bool isSubSeq(string& s1, string& s2) {
        // code here
        int i=0,j=0,n=s1.size(),m=s2.size();
        while(i<n && j<m)
        {
            if(s1[i]==s2[j]) i++,j++;
            else j++;
        }
        return i==n;
    }
};
