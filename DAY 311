Weighted Job Scheduling
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 71.83%Submissions: 1K+Points: 4
Given a 2D array jobs[][] of size n × 3, where each row represents a single job with the following details:

jobs[i][0] : Start time of the job
jobs[i][1] : End time of the job
jobs[i][2] : Profit earned by completing the job
Find the maximum profit you can earn by scheduling non-overlapping jobs.

Note: Two jobs are said to be non-overlapping if the end time of one job is less than or equal to the start time of the next job. If a job ends at time X, another job can start exactly at time X.
