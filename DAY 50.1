Frequencies in a Limited Array



You are given an array arr[] containing positive integers. 
The elements in the array arr[] range from 1 to n (where n 
is the size of the array), and some numbers may be repeated or absent. 
Your task is to count the frequency of all numbers in the 
range 1 to n and return an array of size n such that result[i] 
represents the frequency of the number i (1-based indexing).







class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to count the frequency of all elements from 1 to N in the array.
    vector<int> frequencyCount(vector<int>& arr) {
        // code here
        vector<int> ans(arr.size());
        
        for(int i=0;i<arr.size();i++){
            ans[arr[i]-1]++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
