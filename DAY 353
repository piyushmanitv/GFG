Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 75.3%Submissions: 24K+Points: 2
You are conductor of a bus. You are given two arrays chairs[] and passengers[] of equal length, where chairs[i] is the position of the ith chair and passengers[j] is the position of the jth passenger. You may perform the following move any number of times:

Increase or decrease the position of the ith passenger by 1 (i.e., moving the ith passenger from position x to x+1 or x-1)
Return the minimum number of moves required to move each passenger to get a chair.
Note: Although multiple chairs can occupy the same position, each passenger must be assigned to exactly one unique chair.
