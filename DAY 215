You are given a 2D integer matrix mat[][] of size n Ã— m and a list of q operations opr[][]. Each operation is represented as an array [v, r1, c1, r2, c2], where:

v is the value to be added
(r1, c1) is the top-left cell of a submatrix
(r2, c2) is the bottom-right cell of the submatrix (inclusive)
For each of the q operations, add v to every element in the submatrix from (r1, c1) to (r2, c2). Return the final matrix after applying all operations.
