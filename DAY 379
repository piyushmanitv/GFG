  public:
    int catchThieves(vector<char> &arr, int k) {
        // Code here
        int n = arr.size();
        int i=0, j=0, ans=0;
        while(i<n && j<n){
            if(arr[i] == 'T' && arr[j] == 'P'){
                if(abs(i-j) <= k){
                    ans++;
                    i++;
                    j++;
