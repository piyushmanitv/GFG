Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 43.26%Submissions: 120K+Points: 4
You are given an array arr[] of integers. Your task is to select any two indices i and j such that i < j. From the 
subarray arr[i...j], find the smallest and second smallest elements. Add these two numbers to get the score of that subarray.

Your goal is to return the maximum score that can be obtained from any subarray of arr[] with length at least 2.

  public:
    int maxSum(vector<int> &arr) {
        int res=0;
        for(int i=0;i<arr.size()-1;i++)
        {
            res=max(res,arr[i]+arr[i+1]);
        }
        return res;
        
    }
