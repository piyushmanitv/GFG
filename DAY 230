Find H-Index
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 53.4%Submissions: 44K+Points: 4
You are given an array citations[], where each element citations[i] represents the number of citations received by the ith paper of a researcher. You have to calculate the researcherâ€™s H-index.
The H-index is defined as the maximum value H, such that the researcher has published at least H papers, and all those papers have citation value greater than or equal to H.

    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        // code here
        sort(citations.rbegin(), citations.rend());
        int h = 0;
        while(h < citations.size() && citations[h] >= h + 1){
            h++;
        }
        return h;
    }
};
