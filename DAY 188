Next Greater Element in Circular Array
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 56.97%Submissions: 41K+Points: 4
Given a circular integer array arr[], the task is to determine the next greater element (NGE) for each element in the array.

The next greater element of an element arr[i] is the first element that is greater than arr[i] when traversing circularly. If no such element exists, return -1 for that position.

Circular Property:

Since the array is circular, after reaching the last element, the search continues from the beginning until we have looked at all elements once.








class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> nextLargerElement(vector<int> &arr) {
        // code here
        int n = arr.size();
        vector<int> nge(n,-1);
        stack<int> st;
        
        for(int i = 0;i<2*n;i++){
            
            while(!st.empty() && arr[i%n]>arr[st.top()]){
                nge[st.top()] = arr[i%n];
                st.pop();
            }
            
            if(i<n){
                st.push(i);
            }
        }
        
        return nge;
    }
};
