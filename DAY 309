Get Minimum Squares
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 45.22%Submissions: 44K+Points: 4
Given a positive integer n, find the minimum number of perfect squares (square of an integer) that sum up to n.

Note: Every positive integer can be expressed as a sum of square numbers since 1 is a perfect square, and any number can be represented as 1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1 + ....











class Solution {
  public:
    int minSquares(int n) {
        // Code here
        vector<int> dp(n + 1, INT_MAX);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j * j <= i; ++j) {
                dp[i] = std::min(dp[i], dp[i - j * j] + 1);
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
};
