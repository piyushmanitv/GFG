Koko Eating Bananas
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 50.27%Submissions: 51K+Points: 4Average Time: 20m
Koko is given an array arr[], where each element represents a pile of bananas. She has exactly k hours to eat all the bananas.

Each hour, Koko can choose one pile and eat up to s bananas from it.

If the pile has atleast s bananas, she eats exactly s bananas.
If the pile has fewer than s bananas, she eats the entire pile in that hour.

Koko can only eat from one pile per hour.


Your task is to find the minimum value of s (bananas per hour) such that Koko can finish all the piles within k hours.
