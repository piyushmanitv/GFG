Nth Fibonacci Number






Given a non-negative integer n, your task is to find the nth Fibonacci number.

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence where the next term is the sum of the previous two terms. 
The first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 0 followed by 1. The Fibonacci sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) for n > 1














// User function Template for C++
class Solution {
  public:
    int nthFibonacci(int n) {
        // code here
        int n1 = 0;
        int n2 = 1;
        int ans=0;
        
        if(n == 1) return 1;
        
        for(int i=2; i <= n; i++){ 
            ans = n1+n2;
            n1=n2;
            n2=ans;
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
};
