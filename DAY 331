All Subsets Xor Sum
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 63.71%Submissions: 6K+Points: 4
Given an array arr[], return the sum of the XOR of all elements for every possible subset of the array. Subsets with the same elements should be counted multiple times.

An array a is a subset of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of b.

Note: The answer is guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit integer.
