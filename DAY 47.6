Union of Arrays with Duplicates


Given two arrays a[] and b[], the task is to find the number of elements 
in the union between these two arrays.

The Union of the two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct 
elements from both arrays. If there are repetitions, then only one element 
occurrence should be there in the union.

Note: Elements of a[] and b[] are not necessarily distinct.







class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to return the count of number of elements in union of two arrays.
    int findUnion(vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
        // code here
      unordered_set<int> hashSet(a.begin(),a.end());
        for(int i:b){
            hashSet.insert(i);
        }
        return hashSet.size();
    }
};
