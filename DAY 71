Min Cost Climbing Stairs




Given an array of integers cost[] where cost[i] is the cost of the 
ith step on a staircase. Once the cost is paid, you can either climb 
one or two steps. Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.
Assume 0-based Indexing. You can either start from the step with 
index 0, or the step with index 1.
