Array Leaders


You are given an array arr of positive integers. Your task is to find all the leaders in the array.
An element is considered a leader if it is greater than or equal to all elements to its right.
The rightmost element is always a leader.



class Solution {
    // Function to find the leaders in the array.
  public:
    vector<int> leaders(vector<int>& arr) {
        // Code here
        int n=arr.size();
       vector<int> num;
       int max=INT_MIN;
       for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--){
           if(arr[i]>=max){
               num.push_back(arr[i]);
               max=arr[i];
           }
       }
       reverse(num.begin(),num.end());
       return num;
    }
};
