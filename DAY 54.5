Find Transition Point




Given a sorted array, arr[] containing only 0s and 1s, find the transition point,
i.e., the first index where 1 was observed, and before that, only 0 was observed.  
If arr does not have any 1, return -1. If array does not have any 0, return 0.





class Solution {
  public:
    int transitionPoint(vector<int>& arr) {
        // code here
        for(int i=0; i<arr.size(); i++) {
            if(arr[i]==1) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
