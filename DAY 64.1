First and Last Occurrences



Given a sorted array arr with possibly some duplicates, the task is to find the
first and last occurrences of an element x in the given array.
Note: If the number x is not found in the array then return both the indices as -1.









class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> find(vector<int>& arr, int x) {
        // code here
         int first = -1;
       int last = -1;
    
       for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
        if (arr[i] == x) {
            if (first == -1) {
                first = i; 
            }
            last = i;
           }
      }
        return {first, last};
    }
};
