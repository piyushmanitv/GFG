The Celebrity Problem




A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. 
A party is being organized by some people. A square matrix mat[][] (n*n) is used 
to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j is 
set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. You need to return the index of the
celebrity in the party, if the celebrity does not exist, return -1.

Note: Follow 0-based indexing.
