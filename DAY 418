Max min Height
Difficulty: HardAccuracy: 62.86%Submissions: 32K+Points: 8
Given a garden with n flowers planted in a row, that is represented by an array arr[], where arr[i] denotes the height of the ith flower.
You will water them for k days. In one day you can water w continuous flowers. 
Whenever you water a flower its height increases by 1 unit. You have to maximize the minimum height of all flowers after  k days of watering.
