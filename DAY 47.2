Floor in a Sorted Array




Given a sorted array arr[] (with unique elements) and an integer k, 
find the index (0-based) of the largest element in arr[] that is less 
than or equal to k. This element is called the "floor" of k. If such 
an element does not exist, return -1.








class Solution {
  public:

    int findFloor(vector<int>& arr, int k) {

        // Your code here
        
         int left = 0;
        int right = arr.size() - 1;
        int ans = -1;
        while(left <= right){
            int mid = (left + right)/2;
            if(arr[mid] <= k){
                ans = mid;
                left = left + 1;
            }
            else if(arr[mid] > k) right = mid - 1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
