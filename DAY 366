Intersection in Y Shaped Lists
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 44.67%Submissions: 315K+Points: 4Average Time: 45m
You are given the heads of two non-empty singly linked lists, head1 and head2, that intersect at a certain point. Return that Node where these two linked lists intersect.

Note: It is guaranteed that the intersected node always exists.

In the custom input you have to give input for CommonList which pointed at the end of both head1 and head2 to form a Y-shaped linked list.








// Linked list Node
/*
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;

    Node(int x) {
        data = x;
        next = NULL;
    }
};
*/

class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to find intersection point in Y shaped Linked Lists.
    Node* intersectPoint(Node* head1, Node* head2) {
        // Your Code Here
        unordered_map<Node*, int>mpp;
         Node* temp;
         temp=head1;
        while(temp!=NULL){
            mpp[temp]=1;
            temp=temp->next;
        }
        
         temp=head2;
        while(temp!=NULL){
            if(mpp.find(temp)!=mpp.end()){
                return temp;
                
            }
            temp=temp->next;
        }
        return NULL;
    }
};
