Stock buy and sell





Given an array arr[] denoting the cost of stock on each day, 
the task is to find the maximum total profit if we can buy 
and sell the stocks any number of times.

Note: We can only sell a stock which we have bought earlier 
and we cannot hold multiple stocks on any day.

class Solution {
  public:
    // Function to find the days of buying and selling stock for max profit.
    int stockBuySell(vector<int> &arr) {
        // code here
        int n=arr.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n+1,vector<int>(2,-1));
        dp[n][0]=0;
        dp[n][1]=0;
        for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--){
              dp[i][1]=max(-arr[i]+dp[i+1][0],dp[i+1][1]);
              dp[i][0]=max(arr[i]+dp[i+1][1],dp[i+1][0]);
            
        }
        
        return dp[0][1];
    }
};
