Diameter of a Binary Tree



Given a binary tree, the diameter (also known as the width) 
is defined as the number of edges on the longest path between 
two leaf nodes in the tree. This path may or may not pass through
the root. Your task is to find the diameter of the tree.





class Solution {
  public:
    int dfs(Node* root, int& d) {
        if (!root) return 0;
        int l = dfs(root->left, d), r = dfs(root->right, d);
        d = std::max(d, l + r + 1);
        return 1 + std::max(l, r);
    }

    int diameter(Node* root) {
        int d = 0;
        dfs(root, d);
        return d-1;
    }
};
