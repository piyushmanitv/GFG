Given two matrices mat1[][] and mat2[][] of size n x n, where the elements in each matrix are arranged in strictly 
ascending order. Specifically, each row is sorted from left to right, and the last element of a row is smaller than the first element of the next row.
You're given a target value x, your task is to find and count all pairs {a, b} such that a is from mat1 and b is from mat2 where the sum of a + b is equal to x.












class Solution {
  public:
    int countPairs(vector<vector<int>> &mat1, vector<vector<int>> &mat2, int x) {
        // code here
         int n = mat1.size(), ans = 0;
        for(int i = 0, j = n * n - 1; i < n * n && j >= 0; ) {
            int tmp = mat1[i / n][i % n] + mat2[j / n][j % n];
            if(tmp == x) {
                ans++; i++; j--;
            } else if(tmp < x) i++;
            else j--;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
