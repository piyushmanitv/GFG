Given a 2D array arr[][], where arr[i][0] is the starting time of ith meeting and arr[i][1] is the ending time of ith meeting, the task is to check if it is possible for a person to attend all the meetings such that he can attend only one meeting at a particular time.

Note: A person can attend a meeting if its starting time is greater than or equal to the previous meeting's 
ending time







class Solution {
  public:
    bool canAttend(vector<vector<int>> &arr) {
        // Code Here
        int n=arr.size();
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        
        for(int i=1; i<n; i++){
            if(arr[i][0]<arr[i-1][1]) return false;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
};
