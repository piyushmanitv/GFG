Given an array arr[] of distinct integers and a range [low, high], find all the numbers within the range that are not present in the array. return the missing numbers in sorted order.








class Solution {
  public:
    vector<int> missinRange(vector<int>& arr, int low, int high) {
        // code here
        int n = arr.size(), i = 0;
        vector<int>res;
        
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        
        while(low <= high && i <= n-1)
        {
            if(arr[i]<low) i++;
            else if(arr[i] == low) {
                i++; low++;
            }else if(arr[i] > low) {
                res.push_back(low);
                low++;
            }
        }
        while(low <= high) res.push_back(low++);
        return res;
    }
};
