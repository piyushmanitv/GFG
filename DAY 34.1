Height of Binary Tree




Given a binary tree, find its height.

The height of a tree is defined as the number of edges on 
the longest path from the root to a leaf node. A leaf node 
is a node that does not have any children







class Solution {
public:
    // Function to find the height of a binary tree.
    int height(Node* node) {
        if(node==NULL)
        return 0;
        int ans=0;
        queue<Node*> qt;
        qt.push(node);
        while(!qt.empty())
        {
            
            int size=qt.size();
            while(size--){
            Node *curr=qt.front();
            qt.pop();
             if(curr->left)
             {
                 qt.push(curr->left);
             }
             if(curr->right)
             {
                 qt.push(curr->right);
             }
            }
            ans++;
        }
        return ans-1;
    }
};
