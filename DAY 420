The Painter's Partition Problem-II
Difficulty: HardAccuracy: 27.52%Submissions: 168K+Points: 8
Given an array arr[] where each element denotes the length of a board, and an integer k representing the number of painters available. Each painter takes 1 unit of time to paint 1 unit length of a board.

Determine the minimum amount of time required to paint all the boards, under the constraint that each painter can paint only a contiguous sequence of boards (no skipping or splitting allowed).









class Solution {
  public:
    int minTime(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        // code here
        int start =0,end=0,mid,ans;
        int size = arr.size();
        for(int i=0;i<size;i++){
            start = max(start,arr[i]);
            end+= arr[i] ;
        }
        while(start<=end){
            mid = start + (end-start)/2;
            int board =0,count=1;
            for(int i=0;i<size;i++){
                board+=arr[i];
                if(board>mid){
                    count++;
                    board=arr[i];
                }
            }
            if(count<=k){
                ans = mid;
                end = mid-1;
            }
            else
                start = mid+1;
        }
        return ans;
