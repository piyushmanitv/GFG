Given an array, arr[] of rope lengths, connect all ropes into a single rope with the minimum total cost. The cost to connect two ropes is the sum of their lengths.

    int minCost(vector<int>& arr) {

            pq.push(arr[i]);
        }
        
        while(pq.size() > 1)

            int x = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
