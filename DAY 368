Flattening a Linked List
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 51.53%Submissions: 201K+Points: 4Average Time: 40m
Given a linked list containing n head nodes where every node in the linked list contains two pointers:
(i) next points to the next node in the list.
(ii) bottom points to a sub-linked list where the current node is the head.
Each of the sub-linked lists nodes and the head nodes are sorted in ascending order based on their data. Flatten the linked list such that all the nodes appear in a single level while maintaining the sorted order.

Note:
1. ↓ represents the bottom pointer and → represents the next pointer.
2. The flattened list will be printed using the bottom pointer instead of the next pointer.










/* Node structure  used in the program

struct Node{
    int data;
    struct Node * next;
    struct Node * bottom;

    Node(int x){
        data = x;
        next = NULL;
        bottom = NULL;
    }

};
