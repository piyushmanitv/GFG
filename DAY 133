Given two integer values n and r, the task is to find the value of Binomial Coefficient nCr

A binomial coefficient nCr can be defined as the coefficient of xr in the expansion of (1 + x)n that gives the number of ways to choose r objects from a set of n objects without considering the order.
The binomial coefficient nCr is calculated as : C(n,r) = n! / r! * (n-r) !
Note: If r is greater than n, return 0.
It is guaranteed that the value of nCr will fit within a 32-bit integer.

        if(r==1)return n;
        if(dp[n][r]!=-1)return dp[n][r];
        return dp[n][r]=(solve(dp,n-1,r-1)%mod + solve(dp,n-1,r)%mod)%mod;
    }

        return solve(dp,n,r);
